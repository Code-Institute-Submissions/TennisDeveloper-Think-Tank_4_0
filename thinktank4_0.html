            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right quotation_mark"></i> In 2019 I met Andreas. He was 45, tall, and handsome, he had 2 master's degrees and PhD in biomedical
            research. Andreas spoke several languages fluently, played very well on guitar, was a wonderful artist, and
            was a great ice hockey player.<br><br>He left academia as an Associate Professor at one of the best
            universities in the world. There was nothing he wouldn't know about hisÂ field of research and yet in the
            pharma company
            people would very rarely ask him for his advice. He was responsible for choosing which kind of coffee cups
            we would use at the congress booth - blue or red. And in 2019 he received a company award for selecting the
            best coffee brand for our congress booths. Despite being rather busy at his job he was not using his brain
            capacity at all.<br><br>Then I found several other "Andreases" in other pharma companies around Switzerland.
            They were in different departments, in big pharma or in small biotechs. I called them for a beer in Zurich
            and I realized that I have a group of some 10 people with 35 academic titles. A great brain trust
            with unused brain capacity and hunger for science. Other consultancy companies would have one "Andreas" and
            "their Andreas" would used to work years ago in pharma with very little insight what are the current issues
            and trends in everyday pharma.<br><br>And then I got this epiphany to create our Think Tank, calling it
            Think
            Tank 4.0 to celebrate the 4th industrial revolution and all the new technologies like Web3, AI, machine
            learning, and blockchain. We haven't started anything official, yet we were already approached by several
            types of businesses. Private equity investors and blockchain investors wanted to know where to invest their
            money. Med-tech companies were puzzled about who would be the best customer for their technologies in the
            pharma companies and small biotech needed to bypass some critical milestones with some external help. And we
            could give them advice which would save them time, money and resources.<br><br>Then COVID-19 came and our
            plans
            got interrupted. Also, Andreas is no longer with us. He died during the COVID pandemy. It was a very sad
            time for all of us. Now we are back. I have new people approaching me to join our Think Tank as they heard
            of us and customers who want to know more insides from the insiders. It is a business where we don't have to
            knock on people's doors. <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left quotation_mark"></i>
