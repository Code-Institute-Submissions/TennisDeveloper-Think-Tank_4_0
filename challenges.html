            <h2>We see challenges in pharma business development in the following categories:</h2>
            <h3>People</h3>

            <h4>Employees Fluctuation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a huge fluctuation of employees in the pharma industry due to mergers, acquisitions and
                    restructuring which negatively impacts continuity of projects. Sometimes you might even lose
                    expertise critical for the project's success.</li>
                <li>Think Tank 4.0 offers short-term, mid-term or long-term collaboration on the projects. We can
                    bring all the relevant experts.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Finding the Right Talent</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a whole segment of recruiters and headhunters specialized in finding the right talent for
                    3-6 salaries of the candidate. In Europe you might wait up to 6 months to bring people in.</li>
                <li>Think Tank 4.0 has its experts from all areas of drug development and from many different
                    therapeutic areas. All our consultants have experience with big pharma and biotech companies as
                    strategy experts and content developers.
                    If you book one consultation hour with us, you will get one more for free.
                    <a href="book_call.html" aria-label="Navigation to 'Book a Call or Project' page."
                        id="challenges-hypertext-link">Book it here.</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Geographic coverage, knowledge of the local business regulations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It might be difficult to find the right talent in certain areas due to language barrier, high taxes
                    or low attractivity of the location. Some US or Asian companies hesitate with their expansion to
                    Europe due to complexity of administrative tasks when establishing their presence in Europe.</li>
                <li>We can act as your scouts in your desired geographic location directly or via our partner
                    companies. We can provide market research, regulatory analysis, and patient finding. We can set
                    up your European headquarters in any European country of your choice. </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Drug Development Financing</h3>

            <h4>Too high Costs of Drug Development</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The average drug development cost in prevalent diseases is around USD 1.5 billion and rising. One
                    way to reduce costs in the short to mid term is to bring some parts of the clinical development into
                    Asia or Eastern Europe and use more artificial intelligence aspects.</li>
                <li>Think Tank 4.0 offers to bring partners from Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, or we can
                    facilitate <em>in silico</em> development. You can hire only the minimum number of external experts
                    necessary for your project.</li>
            </ul>





            <h3>Project Success</h3>

            <h4>Most of the projects in pharma fail</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mostly due to a lack of strategy and consistency.</li>
                <li>We are about to release podcasts with examples of the most dramatic failures in pharma.
                    Learning from others' mistakes is much cheaper than learning from your own ones. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Increasing regulatory scrutiny for drug development </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>E.g., the need for pregnancy registries, and ethnic diversity programs.</li>
                <li>Think Tank 4.0 has experience with new regulatory requirements implications on the pharma
                    industry.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Low adoption of med-tech innovations in pharma</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>E.g., blockchain, web3, artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics.</li>
                <li>We can save you money with streamlined operations and increased margins. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Missing negotiation skills to deal with regulatory authorities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a strong belief that the data will speak for themselves. Pharma experts are mainly trained
                    to generate data, but not so much to negotiate with authorities, which could be sometimes key. </li>
                <li>Our strength is the ability to explain complex scientific issues to authorities. We can provide you
                    with Harvard University or FBI trained negotiation experts.</li>
            </ul>



            <h3>Business Expansion into Europe</h3>

            <h4>Expansion to EU country</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>US, Asian and other companies are afraid to expand their business into Europe due to regulatory
                    complexity and low ROI (Return on Investments).</li>
                <li>We can provide a one-stop shop for your business expansion strategy into Europe. We are a
                    multinational team with expertise in establishing European businesses. We can help to find strategic
                    partners in Europe. We could be your gateway into Western or Eastern Europe.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Expansion into Switzerland</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Business expansion to Switzerland for Eastern European countries, India, China, and Latin
                    America is usually a very time-consuming process.</li>
                <li>We can provide a one-stop shop for your business expansion strategy into Switzerland.
                </li>
            </ul>
